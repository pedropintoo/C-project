    This example illustrates the instantiation of a view and all the base graphical models
    to be implemented in the minimum level.

#
# create an instance of a View.
#
# A View is a display window where one can capture snapshots of the canvas at a given moment.
# A View holds a set of intrisic properties, every one with a type and a default value:
# - Ox [Number, 0.0], Oy [Number, 0.0] - point of the canvas that appears in the central (sub)pixel of the view window
# - width [Integer, 201] - number of pixels in a row
# - height [Integer, 201] - number of pixels in a column
# - title [String, "No title"] - the main window title
# - background [String, "black"] - the color of the background
#
# The colon (:) is the instantiation operator
# The equal (=) is the assignment operator
# The with construction allows to change several properties for the same object.
#
view : View with {
    width = 601;
    height = 601;
    title = "Illustrating the minimum level graphical models";
    background = "alice blue"; 
}
