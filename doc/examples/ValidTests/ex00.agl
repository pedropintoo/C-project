# AGL holds a set of primitive data types, every one with a default value:
# - Integer [0] - integer number
# - Number [0.0] - integer or real number
# - String [""] - sequence of characters
# - Point [(0.0,0.0)] - a point in canvas coordinates
# - Vector [(0.0,0.0)] - the difference between two points
# - Vector [(0:1)] - a vector may also be defined using polar coordinates (angle:length).
# Here, we are instanciating a 'Number'
#
