t1 : Point = (1,3)+(3:4); # Works, we can add a point with a vector

t5: Point = 2*(1,3); # Works, we can multiply a point by an integer

t6: Point = (1,3)*2; # Works, we can multiply a point by an integer

t9: Number = (1:3)*(3:4) + 2; # Works, we can multiply two vectors

t10: Boolean = 2.0 == 2; # Works, we can compare a float with an integer
